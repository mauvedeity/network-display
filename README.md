This is a suite of tools to send messages across the LAN to the Pi-based LCD screen, and
display them on the screen when they arrive.

HOWEVER, this is intended to demonstrate the concept of what a security problem is, and therefore shouldn't
be used in any kind of live environment, as there's a security issue in the design, which I'm leaving
in place for expository purposes.

Eventually I want to write a series of blog posts [at my blog](https://uselessofblog.blogspot.co.uk/) explaining
what the problem is, what to do about it, and why I bothered.
